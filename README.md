## Description
For this challenge, I created an interactive webpage which allows users to explore a dataset of microbes which [colonize human navels](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).  Users select a subject ID and can see the top 10 microbes present for the subject, as well as a bubble diagram for each different microbe.

The repository features two main deliverables, the html file to generate the webpage, and the Javascript file which generates the visuals from the user input.  Data is accessed from an [API](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json) by a D3 module, and graphs are generated using the Plotly JS library.

## Authorship
The html file to generate the webpage was provided by the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.  All Javascript code was written by Sam Lind.
